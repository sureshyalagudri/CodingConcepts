1.	Different between set and list
List :
•	List is ordered grouping elements
•	List provides positional access in the elements of the collections.
•	We can store duplicate elements in the list.
•	List implements ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector and Stack.
•	List can store multiple null elements.
Set :
•	Unorderd grouping elements.
•	Set doesn’t provides positional access in the elements of the collections.
•	We can’t store duplicate elements in the set.
•	Set implement HashSet and LinkedHashSet interfaces.
•	Set can store only one null elements.
